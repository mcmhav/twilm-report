\begin{abstract}

This report serves as the primary piece of documentation of our attendance to the TDT4290 Customer Driven Project course, hosted at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in the autumn of the year 2012.

Our customer was the Netlight consulting company represented by Peder Kongelf.

We would like to thank our supervisor, Zhu Meng, for his feedback on our work, and also Peder Kongelf for presenting us with the opportunity to work on such an interesting project.

\begin{abstract}

This paper explores how the data from Twitter can be used to supplement the Netflix Prize data, and used for movie recommendations. Twitter is an online social networking service with approximately 9 100 tweets per second. Netflix Prize released a dataset with 100 480 507 ratings divided on 17 770 movies. The idea is that these two sets of data combined can be used to provided better movie recommendations.

We have done evaluation on research regarding the Netflix Prize competition and recommendation algorithms on the Netflix Prize dataset, and found that the most accurate predictions is not always the preferred ones. Dependency on time and other movies also plays big roles. Light running algorithms like k-NN might be preferred, and is subject for future work.



Different designs are proposed in this paper, this includes designs of a framework for harvesting, dataset building and predictions on the dataset.



When harvesting Twitter the supplied APIs from Twitter was not sufficient for creating movie dataset. Time needed to produce a well sized dataset is TODO:fr-tall, which is too long for practical use. Alternative directions have been taken and a data harvesting technique have been implemented and documented. This is a scraping approach, which is not directly applauded by Twitter,  TODO:fr-something-else-perhaps and lead to a harvesting stop till a alternative solutions has been found, or it gets applauded by Twitter.


Suggestions for future work and development is proposed for when the dataset is  acquired, or for use with other datasets.

• Include: contributions, approach, results, advantages.
• Goal: encourage reader to read the paper
• First sentence: summarize the paper
– “In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for
computing the bounding box of a penguin.”


A hybrid web-fronted/console design would be a possible solution to this problem: The power user can make use of their full potential through a console whilst the objects are presented in the web-interface.
