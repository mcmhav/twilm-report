\section{Wonsole1 Objects}
\label{wonsoleobjects}
\subsubsection{Library object specification}
\begin{verbatim}
    function removeSelected ()
    remove all books that are selected in the visible list, will update the web UI and db.

    function listBooks()
    List all books into the console.

    function removeBookByID(_id)
    Remove a book with the given ID. Will update the web UI and db.

    function selectAllToggle()
    Toggle select all books currently in the visible list. Will update the web UI and db.
    This function is coupled with the checkbox for selecting all books in the list.

    function query(parameter1, value1, parameter2, value2 ...)
    Queries the list of books for an array of books where the
    specified book parameters match their respective values.
    May be called with an arbitrary even number of arguments.
    The values will be interpreted as regular expressions if they are strings.

    function generateHTML()

    at the "BOOKTABLE" element in the HTML document.

    function retrieveObjects()
    This function retrieves all objects from the server and updates the web UI and db.
    Will lock the UI until objects have been received.

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Book object specification}
\begin{verbatim}
    function Book(title, author, id)
    Constructor for the Book object. Will add it to the list of Books in LIB.
    Should be used with the new keyword.
    If id is null, the object will be sent to the server, and the id will be returned.
    This will block the UI and then update it.
    Leaving out the id parameter entirely will be interpreted as the id being null.
    id should be null when using this from the console or web UI,
    but defined in the callback function for retrieving Books.

    function saveUpdate()
    Update the book on the server, blocking/unblocking and updating the UI in the process.
    Should be called after altering the Book object's variables.

    function changeAuthor(newAuthor)

    function changeTitle(newTitle)
    Change the name of the book. Will update the web UI and db.

    function toggleSelect()
    Toggle whether this book is selected.
    Will make sure the value of the Book's checkbox is correct, if it exists.

    Remove this book from the system. Will update database and UI.
    function remove()

    function generateHTML()
    Generate HTML element(s) for this book. Will not manipulate the UI by itself.

\section{Sprint 1}
\label{sprint1pb}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [\textbf{A1}] As an administrator, I want to be able to store objects in a persistent database, so that I can migrate data easily.
  \item [\textbf{A2}] As an administrator, I want to reflect the changes in persistent storage back to user sessions within one second, so the users always see the latest updated data.
  \item [\textbf{A3}] As an administrator, I want to be able to work directly with object attributes rather than any form of raw data.
  \item [\textbf{G1}] As a user, I want my saved actions to be replicated on to the server within one second, so that my actions will not be lost and the client and server is consistent
  \item [\textbf{G2}] As a user, I want my changes to be propagated to other users of the system real- time
  \item [\textbf{G3}] As a user, I want to be able to see the console and graphical interface at the same time, so that I can use them both side by side simultaneously.
  \item [\textbf{G4}] As a user, I want the changes in console reflect in graphical user interface and likewise, so that I can have overview of the changes I made and I can understand easily, how the system works. In addition this will ensure consistency between the console and graphical interface.
  \item [\textbf{G5}] As a user, I want access to a tutorial, so that I can learn to work with the system easily.
  \item [\textbf{G6}] As a user, I want to be able to display the currently available commands in the console, so I can easily see what I can do with the objects at hand.
  \item [\textbf{G7}] As a user, I want to be able to easily repeat and edit last command, so that I can use it on another object.
  \item [\textbf{G8}] As a user, I want to be able to use batch commands, so that I can work with more than one object at the same time.
  \item [\textbf{D1}] As a user, I want to be able to add a new book to the system using both the console and graphical interface.
